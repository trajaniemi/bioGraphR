# bioGraphR
a shiny app for graphing
created for BIO 225, Experiments in Ecology and Evolution, at UMass Dartmouth

BGRbasic.R is a single-file version of the app. It does not use the data and www files. Students with limited R experience can run BioGraphR from RStudio with the package 'shiny' installed.

The current version of BGRbasic has these functions:

Data
<ul><li>Import data from Excel or comma-delimited text files</li>
 	<li>Filter data based on values of variables</li></ul>

Graphs
	<ul><li>Produce histograms, frequency plots, boxplots, bar graphs, and scatterplots</li>
 	<li>Add a grouping variable to a single graph or separate groups into panels</li>
	<li>Add error bars or trend lines</li>
 	<li>Edit axis labels, font sizes, and symbol sizes</li>
 	<li>Reorder values of categorical variables</li>
	<li>Download graphs as .png, .pdf, or .jpg</li></ul>

Statistics
	<ul><li>Create tables of descriptive statistics, with selection of which statistics and number of significant digits</li>
 	<li>Create frequency tables</li>
	<li>Conduct statistical hypothesis tests</li>
 		<ul><li>One-sample, paired, and 2-sample t tests</li>
 		<li>One-way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc tests, residual plots, and Levene's test</li>
		<li>Chi-square goodness-of-fit tests and tests of association</li>
		<li>Correlation</li>
